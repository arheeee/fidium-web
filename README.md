This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Download/clone the repo on your computer:

   ```bash
   git clone https://galex.consolidated.com/procom-dev/fidium-web.git
   ```
2. Run `npm install` within the clone
    ```bash 
    cd fidium-web
    npm install
   ```
3. Copy .env file
    ```bash
    copy .env.example .env
    ```
4. If you successfully copied imported the database following the directions [here](https://galex.consolidated.com/procom-dev/fidium-craft-import). Then you could use the token that's already provided in the `.env` file. Refer back to your settings in `.env` file to add your local environment url.
5. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
